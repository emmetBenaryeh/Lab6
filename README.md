# Lab6
This repository contains the file SequenceAnalysis.py, for more detailed information on this file see my repository SequenceAnalysis. Lab 6 accepts a series of FASTA files representing tRNA sequences. Using these it can determine the shortest possible sequence present in any given tRNA which is not present in any other. In other words the smallest possible string that could differentiate a given tRNA as entirely unique from all others. The theoretical application here is to use these to screen more efficiently for mitochondrial disorders.
